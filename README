few utility scripts for skype parsing, summarizing using bash/awk/sed/grep/sort/uniq...


How to get keywords by date
---------------------------


chatsum.txt is the copy paste of the skype chat.


$ cat chat.txt | ./main-count-global-words |  tee data_global_words.d

$ cat chat.txt | ./main-count-words-per-day | tee data_words-per-day.d

$ cat data_words-per-day.d | ./get-kws data_global_words.d 0.7 0 > data_keywords_per_day.d


2011-07-18 : style stupid shows hello globals exact elements choose bah act 
2011-07-19 : separate security rainy inthe fall extended 
2011-07-20 : weird vanished theirs taxes rights recuperate protected oula nerd mysql manage edited databases confirmation categories accounts 
2011-07-21 : password root ftp btw


You get the tfidf-ed keywords per day in the last file. The count-global-words is very slow. Most probably could be improved vastly. You pipe in the words per day and give global words file as argument, second argument is minimal tfidf score, third is 1 if you want to see the score, 0 if not.

- chat.txt was 220kB, data_keywords_per_day.d was 2.7kB so almost 100x reduction of text while the core activity was still relatively "visible" :).


How to get daily stats
----------------------

cat chatsum.txt | ./parse-skype | ./get-time-msgcnt

2011-09-22 7-05-PM 7-19-PM      13
2011-09-23 7-11-AM 6-49-PM      3
2011-09-24 10-25-AM 10-25-AM    1
2011-09-25 12-50-AM 9-39-AM     2
2011-09-26 3-23-AM 10-44-PM     140
2011-09-27 7-21-AM 11-22-AM     33

You get date, start time, end time, number of messages.


Print day
---------

$ cat chatsum.txt | ./parse-skype | ./print-day 2011-11-12

|2011-11-12|7-36-PM|jane| hello
|2011-11-12|7-37-PM|janko itm| hi

Random Ideas

We could extract links if needed. Added simple search (via grep).
